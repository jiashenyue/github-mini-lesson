# GitHub Mini-lesson
 
This is a mini-lesson designed for GIS certificate students.

## Introduction
According to the [Quickstart Guide of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world):
>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

- What is **Git**?
  - Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management, but we can also use it to manage other types of files.
 
- Why use Git?
  - Tracks history of change (just like you can track different versions of Google Docs)
  - Enables collaboration 
- Is GitHub the only tool for Git?
  - No, it is not. GitHub is not the only software/platform that provides a git system. Alternatives are:
    - GitLab
    - CircleCi
    - Bitbuckets
    - Azure DevOps Server
- I am a non-coder. Why should I learn Git and GitHub?
  - **Documentation**
    - GitHub repositories allow for the documentation of projects. Even non-coding projects benefit from well-documented processes and outcomes. This can showcase your ability to create clear and comprehensive documentation.
  - **Showcasing Non-Coding Projects**
    - GitHub isn't limited to code. You can use it to host and share various types of projects, such as writing samples, design files, or other creative works. This allows you to showcase your skills in areas other than coding.
  - **Demonstrating Technical Familiarity**
    - Including a GitHub profile on your CV demonstrates a level of technical familiarity, even if you're not a coder. Employers appreciate individuals who are comfortable using modern tools and platforms.
