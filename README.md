This is a mini-lesson designed for GIS certificate students.

## Introduction
According to the [Quickstart Guide of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world):
>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

- What is **Git**?
  - Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source code management but we can also use it for managing other types of files.
 
- Why use Git?
  - Tracks history of change (just like you can track different versions of Google Docs)
  - Enables collaboration 
- Is GitHub the only platform for Git?
  - Clearly, GitHub is not the only software/platform that provides a git system. Alternatives are
    - GitLab
    - CircleCi
    - Bitbuckets
    - Azure DevOps Server
- I am a non-coder. Why should I learn Git and GitHub?
